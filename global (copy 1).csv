Panelist,Q1,
X," Indeed outreach is the basic type of the way of communicating about science and more technical topics with a broader audience. The challenge of outreach in Quantum Technology is that, it is an extremely complex topic. We need to find different language and approach to explain these technologies to a broader audience. The possibility to creating a different language was already discussed by the former panellists. So, in a way it's a different form of outreach because of the needs goes through concepts which are not easy to explain.",
Y," What is different in Quantum Technology is, apart from the science part, it's diversity. There are a lot of lines which quantum knowledge gives advantage. So, this diversity point is a big challenge. It is important to talk about this, to have and outreach in Quantum Technology. I think here technology part makes outreach of the science more appealing. Because once it touches your life, the science behind them becomes much more interesting. I think it's important to profit from that technology that is building to empower our curiosity in general. These moments are empowering people with knowledge that might be applied in different context of our lives as well.",
Z," Outreach is important because quantum computing technologies are emerging technologies, and similarly to other fields you need experts for further development. But, since it's an emerging technology there would not that many people who have sufficient knowledge. In most of the universities, there are not many quantum computing courses and programs. So, it's important to popularise quantum computing, that is why also outreaching is important. How it is different is similar as X said, it is not easy to explain it to other people due to the reason that it requires quite good background from different domains. It's an interdisciplinary field. I believe that it's more difficult than in the cases of many other emerging technologies.",
T," For me, a big part of outreach is to inspire. I feel more obligation to do outreach. If somebody 66 years old says ""Wow, that's cool"", and maybe gets inspired to learn more about it, that to me is a win. Even if they never become quantum physicist. That inspiration drives maybe not necessarily from literacy, but awareness. I can't speak about what makes quantum particularly different because I don't know the other kinds of outreaches. But, I think that the part of it makes people aware of the social implications, and getting people excited about quantum teleportation, at the same time telling them it's not a supernatural thing that they imagined.",
X," Y mentioned a war technology. How in principle this word could attract many people is because it makes it more real, more concrete. On the other side, Quantum Technology in general is already a sort of science-fiction topic. In that sense, it brings two points. One is the word technology in the case of quantum, may not be so helpful for the general public. Because general public is attracted by the aura of mystery behind it. But, technology part could make it more attractive for business, for people who would like to invest. Second thing is this sci-fi aura around quantum brings to the topic of responsibility. It's something real based on scientific laws. It is our duty, we as instructors, to make it more concrete and less fuzzy.",
,,
T," It means a lot of different thing, but the notion of responsibility can be considered as what you are telling people. It's not just lying to people, but making sure that you are meeting them at a level. I talk to every individual in a different level according to their age, or their educational background. We have the responsibility to meet people at their level. How you get your message across is crucial because we have to temper their expectation without overselling quantum.",
Z," Responsibility for academics, and researchers is to engage in outreach. Educating people is to not sell some promises that is not possible to fulfil in the future. To be honest about what quantum computers can do, how they can help to society, support science and industry in general. Not to oversell is very important, but to engage in outreach, and educate people as much as possible.",
Y," I would like to come back to the diversity part. It is our responsibility when we talk to a person which topics we bring to them in terms of applications, not the science. Because we are shaping the attitude in this way. Without over or underestimating other technologies, we have to talk more about diversity.",
X," Responsibility in Quantum Technology diversity, reducing the hype are called by other panellists. So, I would highlight Y's point. There are often overpopulation of men and less by women, we should really point towards diversity and openness of this community.",
,,
X," Hype part I already mentioned. In the direction of the target audience, we should be inclusive. We should find the way of communicating with everyone. But, I would also say that, in terms of specialists, it's still too much linked to physics department. I think it's extremely important to bring people from outside of the physics department in Quantum Technology. Because the future of Quantum Technology will only be possible if we could include others. If we want this ecosystem keep growing, and to be successful, we need other roles which cannot be filled only by psychists.",
T," In terms of what the community is doing wrong, I think there is too much focus on computing. We should talk about computing but there are other cool stuff other than computing. I would love to see outreach focus on other aspects.",
Z," Similar to X, the hype of quantum is probably one of the biggest issue and besides that, there is overselling of quantum computing. Also spreading fake news about Quantum Technology. I think it's similar to the other emerging technologies. If there is a new technology, usually you have some buzz words. So, it's a responsibility of experts and researchers to look up for the fake news, and trying to explain what is true, and what is not necessarily true.",
R," This is a real issue, in terms of popularizing of these technologies, without getting familiar with them. And the outcome is counter-productive.",
Y," I believe what we miss, rather than what we do wrong, is also important. A lot of effort is done by the same scientists and engineers. This is great, it ensures the content is proper. But, this is not enough, and also it overloads people if they don't have a support system. What I mean by a support system is a local company/group/institute that takes care of providing an infrastructure, and helps to the communication process. This local infrastructure takes what is the best in the area and allows the researchers to do their work in the best way, and in large scale we are missing this unit.",
X," That's a good point. Infrastructure helps, but we still face the challenges of putting people together who majored in different areas.",
,,
T," Population wise, I think we should focus on students. But, if we move into the industry, we should focus on the educated folks. Also, we should focus on policy makers. So, students, folks that work in industry that can be affected and policy makers.",
Z," Short answer would be everyone indeed, but for a specific group, I believe that outreach should be directed to researchers, PhD students and students in computer science. Those people have already very good background, they can start having the immediate impact.",
Y," It depends on the what you want to achieve. If we want to achieve workforce, one needs to do outreach to students, PhD students, and even the post-doctoral students where the qualification comes. If you want an interdisciplinary field, the experts of other areas. If you need users of technology, then you need to go to talk users. We don't need to chose because each of us interested in different things.",
X," I agree that defining what do you want to achieve is important, but also the timeline is important. If you look in the future, you look for the young students. On the other hand, if you want to get workforce, you look for master and PhD students. But, if you want to move the ecosystem that exists now all at once, then you need to talk with executives and policy makers. Also, I about the different skills and different roles for pushing forward this ecosystem, let's take the case of the developer of quantum computer. For developing a software that programs the quantum computer, you need several layers. Imagine this as sort of a shell. At the very core, you have a programming language, and it doesn't require any quantum knowledge. The developer only needs to know the code and how to talk to the chip. Then on the outer shell, as soon as you get closer to the algorithms, the applications then the developer needs to know a bit of quantum computing. In the very outer shell, there has to be an expert on quantum computing. So, in order to have the full stack, you need different roles. That's why we should target other departments.",

X," I think there is some resistance and indeed it's natural. If there's something new, naturally there is some resistance. On the other, side I think we are moving on this direction. As for chemistry, there is an initial interest, and there is for sure some resistance. I think it is definitely compatible, it just needs a bit of work.",
T," One thing about chemists, that they do have a background in quantum. They are not starting from zero.",
Y," I encountered a lot of chemists where I work. In advanced chemical modelling there is a lot of quantum mechanics in it. So, their perspective for quantum computing is kind of a competitor because of the model they use. They are used to their model, and learning a new one, as they explained me, was tough. Fabia, which type do you target? More pharmaceutical chemists or more scientist chemist?",
X," I think you need both. If you want the more applied one, it's still a bit early for pharmaceutical chemists to jump in indeed. But, I think they know that in few years if they want to be ready, they need to start now. So, it's the beginning of the field, and they need to be aware of what's going on, and indeed there is interest. But, for the present applications that we collaborate, then it's scientists.",
Z," In general, I didn't experience much resistance, but there was just one situation I want to talk about. Quantum machine learning. It was a machine learning conference for students and for people from computer science and math fields. And in the end the organizers decided just not to allocate the sloth for such a talk. When I asked them what was the reason, they said that they don't believe in the shortened quantum computing. So, they think that there are no science that quantum computers will be available for near future. Computer science domain is still growing so fast that even two years from now it's a new era. But, when we talk about the five-fifteen years of horizon, as in the case of Quantum Technology, then it's a lot. It might be also one of the reasons why it can be challenging to get involved more people from the computer science background. Because they already have many interesting projects.",
R," The level of activity there is, much greater than even the combined quantum field. So, it's rather understandable for them to be not as excited as we are.",
,,
T, More brains we get working in Quantum Technology in whatever capacity the better off we will be. We don't have to limit quantum into just a small subset.,
X," I want to stress again the diversity, not only in terms of background, but also in terms of anything. For the workforce in the future we want to be diverse, in terms of background, age range etc. This issue is really matter of being responsible as educators and people work in outreach. Also it's our responsibility to not increase this hype because it can only damage. As soon as one makes a promise that will not be delivered, it will come back.",
Y," I would like to derive a link between the previous discussion and this onr. For me as an outreach communicator and a scientist, I want these RRI guidelines. I want a list that I can just look at, follow. A useful toolkit for how to progress in your many roles.",
Z," When we compare the emergence of Quantum Technology to the emergence of other technologies in the past, I believe that as a community of researchers, we learned a lot. Hopefully in case of quantum computing we have better tools, also better tools for communication then it was in the past. I believe now we are able to avoid many mistakes that we did in the past, and we are going well.",
